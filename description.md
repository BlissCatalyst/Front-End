## Introduction

Hello! I'm Logan. Thank you for looking at our web application! You can find the rest of my teammembers at the bottom of the landing page. You can also find a link to donate to our Patreon if you wish. Check all of us out by clicking on our Github and LinkedIn links. I feel that my team did an excellent job designing and building this app because we all worked very hard to make it what it is. <br />
Welcome to Moodibeats, the app that helps you search for royalty free music for use with livestreaming and content creation.

## Data Science

To source our music, we use a search and sort algorithm created by our data science teammates. Using an automatic script, they use keywords to add new songs to the website. We run it against the Youtube API as often as we need to keep up the stock of songs when they come out. <br />
Then, to sort them, we us a machine learning algorithm known as logistic regression. Logistic regression uses a sigmoid function which looks like an "S" on a graph. We us a graph like this for each mood. Using meta data, or the song's information, whichever "mood graph" it scores the highest on, that is the mood to which the song is assigned.

## Site Functionality

Logging in using the Google authentication button, you will be redirected to the music browsing dashboard. There, you can browse over a thousand songs. If you click on one you like, you can add it to an existing playlist, or create a new one. Our app makes it easy to find songs that match the mood of a stream or video by using our mood selector. You can even use the search bar to search for anything else you like. You might be able to find something we didn't! If you want to change the order of the songs on your playlists, simply select the playlist you want changed, then drag and drop the songs where you would like them.

## Conclusion

With Moodibeats, you can spend less time looking for royalty-free music and more time creating things that you enjoy! Thank you for reading!
