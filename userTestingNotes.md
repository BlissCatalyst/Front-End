# User-Test Notes

## Instructions given (if not a real streamer/video creator)

    Pretend you are a liveStreamer or video
    Creator on youtube/twitch/facebook,
    you want your viewers to enjoy your video after
    the stream with the music you used. 
    (If you donâ€™t know, these platforms mute 
    or flag videos with copyrighted music).

    You found this website https://moodybeats.netlify.com/ 
    Go through it and think aloud and  see how
    you would use it as a streamer or video creator. 

    Try doing the following:
    1. Register with your google account. If already registered, you can just login.
    2. Browse the songs.
    3. Search songs by mood.
    4. Download songs.
    5. Edit your information (name/email).

    Take note of what gave you a hard time doing the listed tasks and improvements we could do. 

## Script (for real streamers)

    ---------------
    "Hi, we have a school project: a website with a collection of free music to use in streams,
    so that videos wouldn't get muted.
    Would love to get feedback from a real streamer :)"

    "Heres the link https://moodybeats.netlify.com/ . You can stop at any point at all and ask me questions n stuff.
    It would be helpful if you could tell me any difficulties/confusion in using it and anything that we could improve
    on in its functionality or design. Any opinion is welcome too. Don't worry about hurting feelings. We can take it haha"
    ---------------
    Note:
    Good streamers to ask are those who:
    [ ] play music on stream
    [ ] has one or more past broadcasts that are muted
    [ ] less than 3 viewers

### Tester notes

    Tester 1 (not a real streamer/videoCreator)
        -   Filtering through moods is not clear
        -   More info about a track (genre, mood, etc)
        -   Pinning songs to check back later
        -   Playlists
        -   Can't find download button
        -   used a dummy google acc
        
    Tester 2 (real streamer y4nn4rt on twitch)
        -   Could just use youtube for music
        -   Doesn't care if he gets muted
        -   Hesitant on allowing permissions (delete videos and comments)
        -   Stops music when searching
        -   searching by mood is not clear
        -   used a dummy google acc

### Analysis
    
    Common of behavior of the two participants are that they both used dummy accounts. This indicate that they they don't
    trust us/the app, to give us permissions that we asked for when they signed up. We could increase trust if we have 
    more users or an established pressence in the web, or we could lessen the permissions we asked for. 

    Both testers were also not clear on how to filter/search the song by mood. Since the app wouldn't have any popular songs,
    they wouldn't know what title/artists to search for. The search bar seemed to be useless? We could solve this using a dropdown 
    with a number of moods users can select from. 

    One participant pointed out the need of pinning songs that he liked, which would be the same as a playlist. We are working
    on the functionality, but was not implemented yet during the test.

    A couple of bugs/functionality to fix that came up during the test:
        -   music stops when searching
        -   user expected a download button
    
    One sentiment that is quite problematic is "I can just use youtube". Seems that we might not be unique or valuable enough
    for our target users to use daily.
