# User-Test Notes

## Instructions given (if not a real streamer/video creator)

    Pretend you are a liveStreamer or video
    Creator on youtube/twitch/facebook,
    you want your viewers to enjoy your video after
    the stream with the music you used. 
    (If you donâ€™t know, these platforms mute 
    or flag videos with copyrighted music).

    You found this website https://moodybeats.netlify.com/ 
    Go through it and think aloud and  see how
    you would use it as a streamer or video creator. 

    Try doing the following:
    1. Register with your google account. If already registered, you can just login.
    2. Browse the songs.
    3. Search songs by mood.
    4. Download songs.
    5. Edit your information (name/email).

    Take note of what gave you a hard time doing the listed tasks and improvements we could do.

## Script (for real streamers)

    "Hi, we have a school project: a website with a collection of free music to use in streams,
    so that videos wouldn't get muted.
    Would love to get feedback from a real streamer :)"

    Note:
    A good streamers to ask are those who:
    [ ] play music on stream
    [ ] has one or more past broadcasts that are muted
    [ ] less than 3 viewers
